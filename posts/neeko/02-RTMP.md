Real Time Messaging Protocol, RTMP, is a network protocol designed for high-performance transmission of audio, video, 
and data to and from Adobe Flash related technologies. This protocol and its derivatives were most commonly used in 
the Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR. Whilst originally a proprietary protocol Adobe, in rare Adobe win, decided 
to release the protocol publicly online. Like with many good decisions by Adobe, Adobe decided to go back on their 
decision and removed the specification from their website. The documentation is still available via reuploaders like 
the Internet Archive but this sets the theme for most of my interactions with Flash technologies. Whilst Adobe Flash 
may be dead, RTMP has somehow managed to continue its existence through the live-streaming industry and seems to be here 
to stay. Unfortunately, most libraries for RTMP are focused on the live-streaming aspect, and they don't seem to give 
the flexibility required for recreating what I need; requiring me to not only read the documentation but also create a 
library for the protocol in Golang.
